        Dear EE3017/IM2003 Students, <br /> Based on the email from Chief
        Health, Safety &amp; Emergency Officer yesterday to all faculty, staff,
        and students (find the letter here: updated travel and health
        advisory_NTU.pdf ) , please take note of the following if you had
        travelled to mainland China and returned to Singapore on or after 14 Jan
        2020:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          You are required to take Leave of Absence (LOA) for 14 days from the
          day after you arrive in Singapore. Please DO NOT come to the
          EE3017/IM2003 tutorial class during your LOA. Please write to me via
          email if you will be/are on LOA for this reason. I'll follow up with
          you separately to provide the necessary academic help within the next
          two weeks.
        </li>
        <li>
          For students with a residential place in Singapore outside the NTU
          campus, you must remain at your residential place during your LOA,
          even if you have no visible symptoms of illness.
        </li>
        <li>
          For international students with NTU campus accommodation, you will be
          assigned a room at Graduate Hall 1 for 14 days. These rooms will be in
          a block dedicated for isolation purposes only.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <br />
        <strong>To all students:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that you are required to make a Travel Declaration (click on
        this link) online latest by tomorrow 29 January 2020. This information
        is vital to help NTU safeguard the health of everyone in the community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stay healthy and stay connected. <br />
        Best regards,
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        Michelle
      </p>
